# PokemonTypeWEnumV.01
Finally managed to get this working with enums, expandable and functional!

A functional Enum based Pokemon Type Matcher that will tell you what is Strong, Weak, or has No Effect against your chosen types. 

Working on implementing dual type functionality and building out the type data.
